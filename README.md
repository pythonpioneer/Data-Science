# Data-Science
Here I am going to practice some concept of Machine Learning specially Regression techniques.

<h3>Steps to build this project</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Data acquisition</li>
	<li>Regression model building</li>
	<li>Model Testing</li>
	<li>Deployment</li>
</ul>

Now, understand everything in deep and learn how things work.
We are going to build many regression model.
So, let's start with First step of this process

<h3>Data Acquisition</h3>
I am only practicing Machine learning algorithms. So, I have generated the whole data using Python. I have used Random functions to generate the whole data.
The directory <a href="https://github.com/pythonpioneer/Data-Science/tree/master/MLHD/Horse%20Data">Horse data</a> contain all the information about data generation.
